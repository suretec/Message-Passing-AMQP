=head1 NAME

Message::Passing::Output::AMQP - output messages to AMQP.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    message-pass --input STDIN --output AMQP --output_options '{"exchange_name":"test","hostname":"127.0.0.1","username":"guest","password":"guest"}'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A L<Message::Passing> L<AnyEvent::RabbitMQ> output class.

Can be used as part of a chain of classes with the L<message-pass> utility, or directly as
a logger in normal perl applications.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 routing_key

The routing key for all messages, defaults to ''.

=head2 header_cb

Optional callback function which gets passed the message before it is
serialized using L</serialize_cb>.
Should return a hashref which gets passed to publish( header => ).

NOTE: if you want to set the message headers (note the s) you have to pass them inside headers, e.g.:

  {
      content_type => 'application/json',
      headers => {
          key => 'value',
      }
  }

=head2 serialize_cb

Optional callback function which gets passed the message and should return a
scalar. This is useful when passing structured messages e.g. hashrefs or
objects where some attributes should be accessible for the L</header_cb> function.
If the serialization happens before using a L<Message::Passing::Role::Filter>
it would require to deserialize it again in header_cb.
To use a Message::Passing filter you can instantiate it and pass it's filter
function to serialize_cb:

  my $filter = Message::Passing::Filter::Encoder::JSON->new(output_to => undef);

  ...

  {
      serialize_cb => sub { $filter->filter(shift) },
  }

=head1 METHODS

=head2 consume

Sends a message.
